Starting training run in /runs/axo-2024-01-08-15-39-45-c7ef
The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `2`
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.

WARNING: Manual override via BNB_CUDA_VERSION env variable detected!
BNB_CUDA_VERSION=XXX can be used to load a bitsandbytes version that is different from the PyTorch CUDA version.
If this was unintended set the BNB_CUDA_VERSION variable to an empty string: export BNB_CUDA_VERSION=
If you use the manual override make sure the right libcudart.so is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
For example by adding the following to your .bashrc: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_cuda_dir/lib64

Starting training run in /runs/axo-2024-01-08-15-39-45-c7ef
The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `2`
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
